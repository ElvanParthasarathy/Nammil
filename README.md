## ⚙️ App Configuration & Settings

Nammil offers deep configuration options managed through a robust internal `SettingsManager`:
- **Theme Engine**: Syncs with Windows system settings (Light/Dark/System) dynamically using Electron's `nativeTheme` API.
- **Multi-Account Support**: Manage multiple isolated profiles (e.g., Personal, Work) seamlessly.
- **Bespoke Notification Sounds**: Choose from high-quality custom notification chimes like *Kumizhi*, *Minnal*, *Alai*, *Thendral*, *Thuli*, and *Thullal*.
- **Per-Account Sounds**: Assign specific notification sounds to different accounts so you instantly know who received a message.
- **Dynamic Media Management**: Set up custom local media folders. The app automatically defaults to intelligently locating or creating an `Nammil\Media` directory inside your Documents folder.
- **Auto-Organization**: Toggleable media auto-organization with robust duplicate file handling (Skip/Overwrite).

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) & `npm`
- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- [Windows App SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/)

### Compiling the App & Installer

We have integrated a seamless, one-click PowerShell pipeline that compiles the React app, zips the Electron binaries, injects them into the C# project, and publishes the final `Setup.exe`.

1. Open a PowerShell terminal as Administrator (to bypass execution policies).
2. Run the build script:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build_custom_installer.ps1
   ```
3. Once completed, the final standalone installer will be outputted to:
   `Nammil.Installer\bin\Release\net8.0-windows10.0.26100.0\win-x64\publish\Nammil.Installer.exe`
